## Database Connection Setup

To establish a connection with MySQL database, you can use the following syntax:

```java
    private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name";
    private static final String USERNAME = "your_username";
    private static final String PASSWORD = "your_password";

    DriverManager.getConnection(URL, USERNAME, PASSWORD);
```

Make sure to replace `your_database_name`, `your_username`, and `your_password` with your actual database details.

## Project Background

Initially, the project was implemented in C without any database connection. It utilized a linked list to store data. Later on, the system was rewritten in Java with a database connection to MySQL for efficient data management and retrieval.
